            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This book is intended to give an exact insight into the theory of relativity to those who take an interest in the theory but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.</p>

            <h2>The Special Theory of Relativity</h2>
            <h3>Physical Meaning of Geometrical Propositions</h3>
            <p>In your schooldays, most of you who read this book made acquaintance with the noble building of Euclidean geometry...</p>
            <h3>The Lorentz Transformation</h3>
            <p>Maxwell’s equations—which form the basis of classical electrodynamics—require the same laws of physics to be valid for all coordinate systems moving uniformly relative to one another.</p>

            <h2>The General Theory of Relativity</h2>
            <h3>Principle of Equivalence</h3>
            <p>The observer inside a closed room cannot distinguish whether the force acting upon him is due to gravitation or acceleration of the room.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The theory of relativity has profoundly changed our understanding of time and space...</p>

                <h2>Design Addendum</h2>
                <p>This section explains the reasoning behind the stylistic choices made in the development of this webpage. These choices were made with the goal of improving readability, creating a modern look, and enhancing user experience.</p>
            
                <h3>Font Choices</h3>
                <p>The font used throughout the page is <strong>Arial</strong>, which is a clean and widely used sans-serif font. It ensures the text is legible on all screen sizes and devices, providing a simple yet professional look. Arial is a standard web-safe font, making it a reliable choice for consistency across browsers.</p>
            
                <h3>Heading and Main Text Sizes</h3>
                <p>The main heading (h1) is set to a large font size of <strong>2.5rem</strong> to make it stand out and serve as the focal point of the page. The letter-spacing of <strong>2px</strong> ensures that the title has adequate space between each character, making it easier to read. The other headings (h2, h3) have progressively smaller sizes to create a clear content hierarchy.</p>
                <p>The main body text is set to <strong>1rem</strong>, a comfortable size for reading on all devices, providing a balance between legibility and aesthetics.</p>
            
                <h3>Color Choices</h3>
                <p>The color scheme was chosen to create a clean and modern aesthetic with high contrast for readability. The header and footer use a <strong>dark background color (#333)</strong>, which contrasts with white text for easy readability. The navigation menu uses a slightly lighter shade of gray (<strong>#444</strong>) to differentiate it from the header while maintaining a cohesive look.</p>
                <p>The hover effect on the navigation links uses a bright yellow color (<strong>#f4b400</strong>) to make it interactive and noticeable, enhancing the user experience.</p>
                <p>The body background is set to <strong>#f4f4f4</strong>, a light gray color that provides a subtle background without being too bright or harsh on the eyes.</p>
            
                <h3>Margin and Padding Choices</h3>
                <p>The margin and padding are carefully adjusted to ensure sufficient space between elements, giving the page a balanced, clean, and spacious feel. The <strong>body</strong> has a default padding around all elements for proper spacing. The <strong>header</strong> and <strong>footer</strong> have padding of <strong>1rem</strong> for balance and easy readability.</p>
                <p>For <strong>sections</strong>, padding of <strong>2rem</strong> is added to create enough space inside the content areas, while a margin of <strong>20px</strong> is used between sections to prevent them from appearing cramped.</p>
                <p>The navigation links have <strong>10px of padding</strong> on each side and a <strong>15px margin</strong> between them to create adequate clickable space and prevent crowding. The hover effect is enhanced by these padding and margin choices to ensure smooth interaction.</p>
